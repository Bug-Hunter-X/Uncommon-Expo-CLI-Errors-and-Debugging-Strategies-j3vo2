The solution involves meticulously examining the project's `package.json`, ensuring all dependencies are compatible with the Expo SDK version.  Additional steps might include checking for conflicting versions of native modules and verifying the correct setup of environment variables.  In some instances, a clean rebuild of the project, after removing the `node_modules` directory and `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` file, can resolve dependency-related issues.  A detailed review of the Expo CLI logs is crucial to pinpoint the source of the problem.  Here's an example:

```javascript
// uncommonExpoSolution.js

// Ensure correct Expo SDK version is specified in package.json
// ...

// Verify dependency compatibility
// ...

// Check for conflicting native modules
// ...

// Clean the project (remove node_modules, yarn.lock or package-lock.json, then reinstall)
// ...
```
