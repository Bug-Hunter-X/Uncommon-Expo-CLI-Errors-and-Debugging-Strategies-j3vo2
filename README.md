# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors and Debugging Strategies

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive error in the Expo CLI and presents a solution.  The error involves seemingly unrelated configurations or dependencies leading to unexpected behavior during development or build processes.

## Problem

The issue is exemplified in `uncommonExpoError.js`, where attempting to use [specific Expo functionality or a 3rd-party library] can lead to an error that isn't readily apparent in the standard error logs. This can manifest as unexpected runtime crashes, build failures, or incorrect application behavior.

## Solution

The solution, detailed in `uncommonExpoSolution.js`, addresses the issue by [describing the correction applied and why it works]. The focus is on identifying the root cause of such uncommon errors, which frequently involve resolving conflicts or ensuring proper setup of dependencies and environment variables.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `expo start` to start the development server.

## Note

This is a template to demonstrate the error and solution.  Replace the placeholder comments and code snippets with your specific issue and resolution for greater clarity.
